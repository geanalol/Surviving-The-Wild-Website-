    <p class= "text"> Polar bears are increasingly going hungry as climate change causes sea ice to melt, reducing their access to hunting grounds for seals, their primary prey. As the ice recedes, they are forced to travel longer distances to find food, often expending more energy than they can afford. This results in malnutrition, lower reproduction rates, and higher mortality, threatening the survival of polar bear populations in the wild. </p>

    <p class= "text"> To help hungry polar bears, we must take urgent action to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and slowing the melting of sea ice. Additionally, protecting their habitats through conservation efforts and supporting sustainable practices can provide polar bears with better access to food and a safer environment.</p>
